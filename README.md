# Mail Server Setup (.deb Package)

This repository contains a `.deb` package for easily installing and configuring a mail server on a Debian-based Linux system. The setup includes **Postfix**, **Dovecot**, and **Mutt** for full mail server functionality, including sending/receiving emails, IMAP/POP3 access, and a terminal-based email client.

## Prerequisites

Before installing the mail server, ensure that you have:

- A **Debian-based** Linux system (e.g., Ubuntu).
- **Root privileges** or `sudo` access.
- Basic knowledge of mail server components (Postfix, Dovecot, Mutt).

## Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Download the `.deb` Package

1. **Download the `.deb` file** from the releases section of this repository.

2. Alternatively, if the file is already on your server, transfer it via SCP, `wget`, or any other file transfer method.

### Step 2: Install the `.deb Package`

1. **Open a terminal** on your server.

2. **Navigate to the directory** where the `mailserverSetup.deb` file is located:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/package
   ```

3. **Install the package** using the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i mailserverSetup.deb
   ```

4. **Fix missing dependencies** (if any) by running:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -f
   ```

   This will automatically resolve any missing dependencies and complete the installation.

### Step 3: Configuration

1. **Set the server's hostname and domain name** during the installation prompts.

   - **Hostname**: Name of your server (e.g., `mail.example.com`).
   - **Domain Name**: Your email domain (e.g., `example.com`).

2. **Set the Mail Name** to match your domain (e.g., `example.com`).

The installation will configure the following services:
- **Postfix**: For sending/receiving emails (configured for "Internet Site").
- **Dovecot**: For IMAP/POP3 access with `Maildir` format.
- **Mutt**: A terminal-based email client.

### Step 4: Verify the Installation

#### 1. Verify Postfix is running:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status postfix
   ```

   You should see output indicating that Postfix is active and running.

#### 2. Verify Dovecot is running:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status dovecot
   ```

   This confirms that Dovecot (IMAP/POP3) is active.

#### 3. Verify Mutt is installed:
   To check if Mutt is working, run:
   ```bash
   mutt
   ```

   You should see the terminal-based email client open, allowing you to send and receive emails.

### Step 5: Sending Test Emails

1. **Send a test email using Mutt**:
   In the Mutt interface, follow the prompts to send an email to a recipient. You can use your own email address or any test account you have configured.

2. **Check for email delivery** in your inbox. If configured correctly, the test email should arrive.

### Step 6: Uninstalling the Mail Server

If you need to remove the mail server at any time, you can uninstall the `.deb` package with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove --purge mailserverSetup
```

To clean up any residual files or unused dependencies, run:

```bash
sudo apt-get autoremove
sudo apt-get autoclean
```

### Troubleshooting

- If **Postfix** or **Dovecot** fails to start, check their logs for any error messages:
  
  - **Postfix logs**:  
    ```bash
    tail -f /var/log/mail.log
    ```

  - **Dovecot logs**:  
    ```bash
    tail -f /var/log/dovecot.log
    ```

- If there are any missing dependencies or issues, try resolving them with:
  
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install -f
  ```

- If Mutt is not displaying or working correctly, make sure that your `mail` configuration is correct in `/etc/Muttrc` or the configuration directory.

### Summary of Key Steps:
1. **Download the `.deb` package.**
2. **Install using `dpkg`** and resolve dependencies using `apt-get install -f`.
3. **Configure hostname, domain, and mail name** during installation.
4. **Verify the status** of Postfix, Dovecot, and Mutt with `systemctl` and `mutt`.
5. **Uninstall** with `apt-get remove --purge` if needed.
6. **Troubleshoot** with logs from `/var/log/mail.log` and `/var/log/dovecot.log`.

This structure provides clear instructions for installation, verification, and troubleshooting with terminal commands for each step.
